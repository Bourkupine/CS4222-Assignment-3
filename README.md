# CS4222-Assignment-3

**Project Description**
We want to develop a tool for storing a list of words. The words will be used in an application that plays a word game. The list of words is loaded from a dictionary of words stored in a file.

The words in the file are stored as a series of lines. Each line can be blank, or it can contain one or more words. If a line contains more than one word then each word is separated from the next using a comma. This is commonly known as Comma Separated Values format or CSV format. As a consequence, the word files used in this project all have .CSV extensions.
